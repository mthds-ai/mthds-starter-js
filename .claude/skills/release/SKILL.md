description: Prepare a new release for the mthds-starter-js project. Bumps version in package.json, syncs package-lock.json, updates CHANGELOG.md, manages the release/vX.Y.Z branch, runs checks, and commits. Use when the user says "release", "prepare a release", "bump version", "new version", or "cut a release".

# Release Workflow

Guides the user through preparing a new mthds-starter-js release in 8 interactive steps. Every step requires explicit user confirmation before proceeding.

## Step 1 — Gather State

Read the following and present a summary:

1. Current version from `package.json` (`"version": "X.Y.Z"`)
2. Latest entry in `CHANGELOG.md` (if it exists — this repo may not have one yet; see Step 6)
3. Current git branch (`git branch --show-current`)
4. Working tree status (`git status --short`)

If the working tree is dirty, **warn the user** and ask whether to continue or abort.

## Step 2 — Determine Target Version

Calculate the three semver bump options from the current version:

- **Patch**: `X.Y.Z+1`
- **Minor**: `X.Y+1.0`
- **Major**: `X+1.0.0`

Present these options to the user using `AskUserQuestion`. If the current branch already looks like `release/vA.B.C` and the version in `package.json` was already bumped, offer a **"Keep current (A.B.C)"** option.

Store the chosen version as `TARGET_VERSION` (no `v` prefix, e.g. `0.1.3`).

## Step 3 — Branch Management

The release branch **must** be named `release/v{TARGET_VERSION}`.

- If already on the correct branch: inform the user and continue.
- If on `dev`, `main`, or another branch: confirm with the user, then create and switch to `release/v{TARGET_VERSION}`.
- If on a _different_ release branch: warn the user and ask how to proceed.

## Step 4 — Update Version in package.json

Edit the `"version": "..."` line in `package.json` to `"version": "{TARGET_VERSION}"`.

- If the version already matches: inform the user and skip.
- Otherwise: use the Edit tool to make the change, then show the diff.

The version in package.json must **not** have a `v` prefix (e.g. `0.1.3`, not `v0.1.3`).

## Step 5 — Sync package-lock.json

After updating `package.json`, regenerate the lock file so it reflects `TARGET_VERSION`:

```bash
npm install --package-lock-only
```

This updates `package-lock.json` without modifying `node_modules`.

- **If the lock file was already in sync**: inform the user and continue.
- **On failure**: show the error and ask the user how to proceed.

## Step 6 — Update CHANGELOG.md

The changelog entry **must** match the format: `## [vX.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`.

If `CHANGELOG.md` does not exist yet (this starter shipped without one initially), offer to create it with a `# Changelog` heading plus the new entry. Otherwise check whether it already contains a `## [v{TARGET_VERSION}] -` entry.

- **If missing**: run `git log main..HEAD --oneline` (or `git log --oneline -20` if on `main`) to review recent commits. Draft a changelog entry from those commits and propose it to the user for approval. Insert the approved entry at the top of the changelog (after the `# Changelog` heading) formatted as:

```markdown
## [v{TARGET_VERSION}] - {TODAY'S DATE in YYYY-MM-DD}

### Added

- Item one

### Changed

- Item two

### Fixed

- Item three
```

Use the appropriate subsections (Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed, Breaking Changes) based on the commits. Only include subsections that have content. The user may accept, edit, or rewrite the proposed entry.

- **If exists**: show the existing entry and ask the user whether to keep it or edit it.

## Step 7 — Run Checks

Run:

```bash
make all
```

This runs lint + format-check + typecheck + unit tests + production build (per the project's `Makefile` and `CLAUDE.md`). It deliberately excludes `make test-e2e`, which hits the live MTHDS API and costs an LLM call.

- **On success**: report and continue.
- **On failure**: show the errors and ask the user how to proceed (fix issues, skip checks, or abort).

If the release touches the SDK call path (`src/actions/`, `src/lib/mthdsClient.ts`, `src/lib/loadBundle.ts`, `src/lib/errors.ts`, `src/lib/fileEncoding.ts`, or `methods/`), offer to also run `make test-e2e` — but only with explicit user approval, since it costs LLM calls.

## Step 8 — Review & Commit

Present a full summary:

- Target version: `v{TARGET_VERSION}`
- Branch: `release/v{TARGET_VERSION}`
- Files changed: `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `CHANGELOG.md`
- Changelog entry preview

Ask the user to confirm. On confirmation:

1. Stage **only** `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and `CHANGELOG.md` — never use `git add .` or `git add -A`.
2. Commit with message: `Bump version to {TARGET_VERSION} and update changelog`
3. Show the commit result.

Then offer (but do not automatically execute):

- **Push** the branch to origin (`git push -u origin release/v{TARGET_VERSION}`)
- **Create a PR** to `main` using `gh pr create` (per `CLAUDE.md`, the PR target branch for this repo is `main`)

Wait for explicit user approval before pushing or creating a PR.

## Rules

- Never use `git add .` or `git add -A` — only stage `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Never push or create PRs without explicit user approval.
- The `v` prefix appears in branch names and changelog headers, but **not** in `package.json`.
- Always use today's date for new changelog entries (format: `YYYY-MM-DD`).
- If any step fails or the user wants to abort, stop immediately — do not continue the workflow.
